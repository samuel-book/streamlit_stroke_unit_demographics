# Stroke unit demographics

## Summary

This app shows the variation of various metrics for geographical areas across England and Wales
and how these compare with their nearest acute stroke unit.

This allows us to check whether the findings of our various stroke projects
are equitable and have a fair balance of equality, diversity and inclusion.

### Other columns in the data tables

There are additional columns in the full data tables. These are the steps towards turning absolute numbers of patients into proportions of patients.

For example, the columns `long_term_health_count` and `all_categories_long_term_health_problem_or_disability` are the absolute numbers of patients that go into calculating the proportion `long_term_health_proportion`.


## How to use this app

Go to the "Interactive demo" in the left sidebar.
There you can select two demographic options and see a map of their variation around England and Wales.

To download the full data tables, hover over the table to toggle a menu in its top-right corner and then press the download button.

To change between light mode and dark mode, change the settings under the Menu in the top right of the screen.
